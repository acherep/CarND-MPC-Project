Even though I passed the MPC project, I still not quite sure about the right solution regarding to use kinematic equations to predict the states for after 100ms before sending them to MPC. I attached the reviewer's update equation and mine. I have two following questions:

(1) During the latency time, do we think the speed is constant? If not, how can we compute px by px = v*latency;
(2) I don't understand why the reviewer's suggest regarding cte. Any ideas?

Here is the reviewer's state update equations which should be applied before sending to MPC:

px = v*latency;
py = 0;
psi = -v*delta*latency/Lf;
epsi = -atan(coeffs[1]) + psi; 
cte= polyeval(coeffs,0)+v*sin(epsi)*latency;
v += a*latency;
state<<px,py,psi,cte,epsi

Following is how I did the state udpate before sending to MPC:

// add latency 100ms
double latency = 0.1;
double Lf = 2.67;
v *= 0.44704;                             // convert from mph to m/s
px = 0 + v * cos(steer_angle) * latency;  // px:  px0 = 0, due to the car coordinate system
py = 0 + v * sin(steer_angle) * latency;  // py:  py0 = 0, due to the car coordinate system
psi = - v / Lf * steer_angle * latency;   // psi:  psi0 = 0, due to the car coordinate system
double cte = polyeval(coeffs, px) - 0;  // since py0=0
double epsi = atan(coeffs[1]+2*coeffs[2]*px + 3*coeffs[3]*px*px);
state << px, py, psi, v, cte, epsi;
